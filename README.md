Game of Thrones is a wildly popular television series by HBO, based on the (also) wildly popular book series "A Song of Ice and Fire" by George R.R. Martin. In this case study, we will analyze the co-occurrence network of the characters in the Game of Thrones books.

The dataset is publicly available for the 5 books.

Note: Here, two characters are considered to co-occur if their names appear in the vicinity of 15 words from one another in the books.

Objectives:
Load all the raw datasets and perform descriptive analysis
Run Network Analysis Algorithms on individual books (and combined)
Calculate the different centralities measures and provide inference
Create Network Graphs using Plotly
Run Louvain Community Detection and find out different groups/communities in the data
